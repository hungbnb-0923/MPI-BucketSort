# Parallel Bucket Sorting Using MPI

# Description
- A comparison of sorting an array of random integers between the numbers of 0 and 100 using a serial mergesort algorithm and a parallel bucket sort algorithm. The efficiency and speedup of the parallel solution is printed after the programs have run.

# Getting Started
- Make sure your system has MPI downloaded
- Then, to run with 4 processes, run these commands:
- run `make` 
- run `mpirun -np 4 bucketsort`
